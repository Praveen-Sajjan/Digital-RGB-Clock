# Digital-RGB-Clock
It's a Simple Digital RGB Clock, created using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
I've additionally used glowing effect in CSS, to make it look more trendy and it looks good in black background.
I majorly focus on CSS in my projects and try to add new and different fonts or use different colours to make it look more modern with the colour palletes which makes the website or a static page look more colourful and engages the audience too.
